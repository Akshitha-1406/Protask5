Task-05: US Traffic Accident Analysis

Objective

Analyze US traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:

Time of day

Day of week

Weather conditions

City-level accident distribution

Dataset

The dataset used was from Kaggle's US Accident EDA project. It includes details like start time, city, weather condition, and more for millions of traffic accidents.

Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning

Parsed Start_Time into datetime format

Extracted Hour, Day, and Month

Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Accidents by Hour: Peak hours were 7–9 AM and 4–6 PM (rush hours)

Accidents by Day: Friday showed a slight spike in number of accidents

Weather Conditions: Most accidents happened during clear conditions, but rain and foggy conditions also contributed significantly

City-Level Distribution: Cities like Los Angeles and Houston had the most reported accidents

3. Visualizations

Included:

Bar plot of accident count by hour

Count of accidents by weekday

Top 10 weather conditions associated with accidents

Top 10 cities with most accidents

Key Findings

Most accidents occur during commuting hours (morning and evening)

Bad weather conditions like rain and fog increase accident frequency

Large urban centers are hotspots due to traffic density

Conclusion

Traffic accidents show strong patterns with respect to time and weather. These insights can help local authorities take preventative measures during high-risk periods and under adverse weather conditions.
